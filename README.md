# Cat vs. Dog Classification Using CNN
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using Keras and TensorFlow on a dataset of labeled images and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.

## Project Structure
Cats_Dogs_classification_CNN.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Usage

  1)Training the Model:
  The notebook contains code for training a CNN model on a dataset of cat and dog images. You can adjust the hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and 
  learning rate as needed
  
  2)Evaluating the Model:
  After training, the notebook includes code to evaluate the model's performance on the validation/test set and visualize the results.


## Dataset
This project requires a dataset of cat and dog images. The dataset used in this notebook can be obtained from the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats competition. Please download and extract the dataset before running the notebook.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

1)Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
2)MaxPooling layers
3)Fully connected (Dense) layers
4)Dropout layers for regularization
5)Softmax activation in the final layer for classification

## Results
The model achieves a significant accuracy in classifying cat and dog images. The notebook includes visualizations of training/validation loss and accuracy, as well as examples of correct and incorrect predictions.


## Future Work
  1) Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
  2) Transfer Learning: Experiment with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet to potentially increase accuracy.
